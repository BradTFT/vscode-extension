# VSCode Extension

**4.26.22**
**Day 1:**
I started installing the packages from node from the VSCode extension building documentation. I immidiately ran into errors. I made a stackoverflow post and i am awaiting a response. (you can see the full error on my profile: https://stackoverflow.com/users/18603040/bradtft). 3 hours later, still no update for fixes.
